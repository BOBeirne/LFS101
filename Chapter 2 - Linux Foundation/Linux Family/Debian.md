# The Debian Family

- **Upstream for several distros** ( incl. `Ubuntu`)
- commonly used in both desktops and servers

- The **largest and most comprehensive software repo of any Linux distro**
- Uses `apt`/`dpkg` package management (shared by all Debian family)

### Ubuntu

- Upstream for `Linux Mint`
- Different UI - Uses GNOME desktop but with Ubuntu-specific customizations (dock, styling, extensions — not a different DE, just a modified GNOME)
- Focuses on **compromising between long-term stability and ease of use**
- Also has access to **very large software repo**
- widely used for cloud deployments (dominant on AWS, Azure, GCP)
- `Ubuntu LTS` (Long Term Support) Will be used throughout this course 
	- supported for 5 years, new LTS every 2 years

### Linux Mint
