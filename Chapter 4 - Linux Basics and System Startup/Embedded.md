Embedded Linux is a Linux OS run on dedicated-purpose hardware

### Examples:

- Routers, modems
- Smart TVs, Stream Boxes
- Raspberry pi
- car infotainment systems
- security cameras
- smart home devices (thermostats/doorbells)
- ATMs, point-of-sale terminals
- Industrial controllers

### How it differs

- Stripped down to bare essentials
- usually read-only filesystems to avoid corruption
- flash storage ( jffs2/yaffs/ubifs filesystems )
- Lower hardware specs
- Often minimal or no GUI

### Common Distributions

- OpenWrt (routers)
- Android
- Yocto/Buildroot (custom embedded builds)
